# AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project presents an AI-powered system for detecting credit card fraud. With the rapid growth of online transactions, fraud detection has become crucial. Our model leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes significant financial loss globally. Manual and rule-based systems fail to adapt to evolving fraud tactics. We propose an automated system using intelligent models to detect anomalies in transaction patterns.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust fraud detection model
- Handle data imbalance effectively
- Provide interpretable visual insights
- Build a deployable app for real-time analysis

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraud Cases**: 492
- **Features**: Time, Amount, PCA components (V1-V28), Class (0: Non-fraud, 1: Fraud)

## Data Processing
- Normalized Time & Amount
- SMOTE oversampling for minority class
- Feature extraction (e.g., transaction hour)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC and PR Curves
- Feature Importance
- Fraud trend analysis

## Tools & Libraries
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, plotly
- **Deployment**: Streamlit, Gradio

## Team Contributions
- **Data Cleaning**: Sriram N
- **Feature Engineering**: Sathish S
- **Model Development**: Mohammed Sulthan G
- **EDA**: Paramaguru
- **Documentation**: Surya V
